# Build Office add-ins using Teams Toolkit
Office add-ins are integrations built by third parties into Office by using our web-based platform. This add-in template supports: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook.
Now you have the ability to create a single unit of distribution for all your Microsoft 365 extensions by using the same manifest format and schema, based on the current JSON-formatted Teams manifest.

> Note:
> The unified app manifest for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint is in preview. Visit [this link](https://aka.ms/officeversions) to check the required Office Versions. Also, publishing a unified add-in for Word, Excel, PowerPoint is not supported currently.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20, 22.
- Word/Excel/PowerPoint for Windows: Beta Channel, Build 18514 or higher. Outlook For Windows, Build 16425 or higher. Follow [this link](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/How-to-switch-Outlook-client-update-channel-and-verify-Outlook-client-build-version) for switching update channels and check your Office client build version.
- Edge installed for debugging Office add-in.
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher.

## Debug Office add-in
- Please note that the same M365 account should be used both in Teams Toolkit and Office.
- From Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by choosing launch profile (default value is Word) in `Run and Debug` pane and hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code. Please run VSCode as administrator if localhost loopback for Microsoft Edge Webview hasn't been enabled. Once enbaled, administrator priviledge is no longer required.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the app manifest in `./appPackage` folder. The folder contains one manifest file:
* `manifest.json`: Manifest file for Office add-in running locally or running remotely (After deployed to Azure).
You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-app-schema/preview/op/extensions/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json) for more information.

- Edit webpack.config.js file and change `urlProd` to the value you just copied. Please note to add a '/' at the end of the URL.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Run `npx office-addin-dev-settings sideload ./dist/manifest.json`.

## Validate manifest file

To check that your manifest file is valid:

- From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select: `Teams: Validate Application` and select `Validate using manifest schema`.
- From Teams Toolkit CLI: run command `teamsapp validate` in your project directory.
